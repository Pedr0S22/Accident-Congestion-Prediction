# Accident-Congestion-Prediction
This project aims to explore the connection between road accidents and traffic congestion, focusing on public safety and transportation issue. Traffic accidents not only put lives at risk but also cause longer travel times, more fuel use, and economic problems due to traffic delays. By looking at traffic patterns and accident data, this study tries to understand how much accidents affect congestion. The main goal is to provide useful insights that can help city planners, traffic managers, and the police create better traffic control strategies, respond more quickly to accidents, and improve overall road safety. 

## Project Overview

This project uses a large-scale dataset of car accidents across 49 U.S. states, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data). The full dataset includes around 7.7 million accident records and 47 features, collected from various traffic incident APIs between February 2016 and March 2023.

For this project, we work with a sample of 500,000 accidents provided on the same Kaggle page. The goal is to analyze how accidents impact traffic congestion and gain insights that could help improve traffic management and road safety.

The dataset is shared under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), and you can find more details about the dataset [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us%20accidents).
